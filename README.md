# energicview

The goal of the EnergicView project is to enable people, companies, and organizations to 
actively control and optimize their energy use in response to the urgent demand for energy 
monitoring in today's environment. The project presents an Internet of Things (IoT)-based 
solution that uses the ESP32 microcontroller 2 Channel Relay and the ACS712-5A current 
sensor to quantify energy use precisely in light of rising energy costs and environmental 
concerns. The accompanying Flutter-developed mobile application gives customers instant 
access to real-time data transfer and energy consumption analytics. 
EnergicView includes advanced data analytics to visualize electricity usage through 
various graphs and integrates a prediction model to forecast next month's energy 
consumption. Additionally, the system incorporates relay functionality, allowing remote 
control of electronic appliances through Firebase, further enhancing user convenience and 
energy management capabilities.
